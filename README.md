# 👨‍🍳 The FlavorForge Story

FlavorForge began as a simple recipe-sharing application designed to provide users with an intuitive platform for discovering and exploring recipes through a modern web interface.

While the application itself is straightforward, the primary objective of this project extends far beyond application development.

The engineering challenge was to transform a full-stack application into a **production-inspired cloud-native platform** by implementing:

* DevSecOps automation
* Containerization
* Cloud infrastructure
* Kubernetes orchestration
* Continuous integration
* Security scanning
* Code quality analysis
* GitOps
* Deployment verification
* Operational monitoring
* Engineering documentation

The project demonstrates the journey from application source code to a running application on **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

**The application is the product.**

**The DevSecOps platform behind it is the engineering story.**

# 🎯 Project Objective

Developing an application is only one part of modern software engineering.

A production-oriented platform must also address questions such as:

* How are application changes validated?
* How is code quality checked automatically?
* How are container vulnerabilities identified?
* How are application artifacts packaged consistently?
* How are container images securely stored?
* How are workloads deployed to Kubernetes?
* How are Kubernetes configurations maintained across environments?
* How can deployments be verified?
* How can application workloads scale?
* How can operational health be monitored?
* How are deployment failures investigated?

FlavorForge addresses these challenges by implementing an **enterprise-inspired DevSecOps workflow** using GitHub, Azure DevOps, Docker, Azure Container Registry, AKS, Kubernetes, Kustomize, SonarCloud, Trivy, Argo CD, and Azure monitoring capabilities.

The project demonstrates:

* ✅ Automated CI/CD using Azure DevOps
* ✅ Continuous code-quality analysis using SonarCloud
* ✅ Container vulnerability scanning using Trivy
* ✅ Docker-based application containerization
* ✅ Private image storage using Azure Container Registry
* ✅ Kubernetes orchestration using AKS
* ✅ Environment configuration using Kustomize
* ✅ GitOps synchronization using Argo CD
* ✅ Kubernetes autoscaling using HPA
* ✅ Application exposure using Ingress
* ✅ Operational visibility using Azure Monitor
* ✅ Multi-layer deployment verification
* ✅ Comprehensive engineering documentation

The objective is not simply to deploy an application, but to demonstrate how software can be **built, validated, secured, packaged, deployed, verified, and operated** using modern DevSecOps practices.

# 🧩 The Engineering Challenge

Traditional application deployments may require developers or operators to manually build an application, create container images, push images, update Kubernetes resources, and verify the deployment.

A typical manual deployment workflow looks like this:

<img width="406" height="507" alt="Traditional deployment workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35b41ef-2a31-44a7-a94c-2b04ca6fa1f2" />

Such deployments introduce risks such as:

* Manual deployment errors
* Configuration inconsistency
* Limited traceability
* Delayed security validation
* Difficult troubleshooting
* Repetitive operational work
* Difficult rollback and recovery

FlavorForge addresses these challenges by introducing automation and validation throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

The resulting workflow is:

<img width="402" height="971" alt="FlavorForge DevSecOps workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07320734-35d3-44f8-a1cc-e64cdb23cfff" />

Each stage introduces another layer of automation, quality assurance, security, operational consistency, and deployment reliability.

# 🚀 From Code Commit to Running Application

The FlavorForge delivery lifecycle follows a structured workflow that transforms source code into a running cloud-native application.

<img width="281" height="927" alt="Code to application workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4fc3199-a01f-445b-b0b8-93fed1e0b65c" />

## 1. Source Control

Application source code, Kubernetes manifests, configuration, automation scripts, and documentation are maintained in GitHub.

Git provides version history and traceability for engineering changes.

---

## 2. Continuous Integration

Azure DevOps executes the multi-stage pipeline.

The pipeline performs activities including:

* Source checkout
* Dependency installation
* Application validation
* Build
* Testing / validation
* SonarCloud analysis
* Docker image creation
* Trivy vulnerability scanning
* Image publishing

---

## 3. Container Registry

Validated Docker images are pushed to:

```text
flavorforgeacr2026ms.azurecr.io
```

Azure Container Registry provides private storage and versioned container images.

---

## 4. Kubernetes Deployment

The pipeline contains a **real AKS deployment stage**.

The deployment process obtains AKS credentials and applies the production Kustomize configuration.

Conceptually:

```text
Azure DevOps
      │
      ▼
AKS Credentials
      │
      ▼
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/prod
      │
      ▼
Update Deployment Images
      │
      ▼
kubectl rollout status
```

This is the actual deployment path implemented in the project.

---

## 5. GitOps with Argo CD

Argo CD is configured to monitor Kubernetes configuration stored in Git and synchronize the cluster with the declared desired state.

This provides a practical demonstration of GitOps principles including:

* Declarative configuration
* Git-based desired state
* Synchronization
* Drift visibility
* Deployment traceability
* Application health visibility

> **Important implementation detail:** Azure DevOps currently performs the actual AKS deployment stage. Argo CD is also implemented to demonstrate GitOps-based synchronization and desired-state management. The project therefore demonstrates both the operational deployment pipeline and the GitOps model rather than claiming that Argo CD is the only deployment mechanism.

---

## 6. Operations and Verification

After deployment, Kubernetes resources and the application are verified.

Verification includes:

* Pods
* Deployments
* Services
* Ingress
* HPA
* Application accessibility
* Backend health
* Argo CD synchronization
* Kubernetes workload health

#### Evidence

![Azure DevOps Pipeline](screenshots/pipeline/13-pipelines-run.png)

*Figure 9.1 – Successful execution of the Azure DevOps multi-stage pipeline.*

---

# 🚦 Pipeline Stages

## Stage 1 — Source Validation

The pipeline retrieves the source repository and prepares the build environment.

### Activities

* Checkout source code
* Validate repository structure
* Prepare build environment
* Restore project dependencies

### Objective

Ensure that valid source code progresses through the pipeline.

---

## Stage 2 — Application Build and Validation

The application is built and validated before container images are produced.

### Activities

* Install frontend dependencies
* Install backend dependencies
* Build application artifacts
* Validate application structure
* Run application-level validation

### Objective

Detect application failures early.

---

## Stage 3 — Code Quality Analysis

SonarCloud performs static code analysis.

The analysis evaluates areas such as:

* Bugs
* Code smells
* Maintainability
* Technical debt
* Security hotspots

The project integrates SonarCloud quality validation into the pipeline.

---

## Stage 4 — Docker Build

Frontend and backend applications are packaged into Docker images.

The project uses multi-stage Docker builds where applicable to separate build-time dependencies from production runtime components.

## Stage 5 — Trivy Security Scan

Trivy scans container images for known vulnerabilities.

The documented scan results include:

* Backend image: **12 HIGH / 1 CRITICAL**
* Frontend image: **11 HIGH / 0 CRITICAL**

The critical backend finding was associated with the `tar` package. A fixed version was identified.

> Security scanning provides visibility into vulnerabilities. A successful pipeline should not be interpreted as meaning that an image contains zero vulnerabilities.

#### Evidence

## Stage 6 — Push to Azure Container Registry

After image creation and security validation, images are tagged and published to:

```text
flavorforgeacr2026ms.azurecr.io
```

---

## Stage 7 — Real AKS Deployment

The project contains a **real AKS deployment stage**.

The deployment process:

1. Obtains AKS credentials.
2. Applies the production Kustomize overlay.
3. Updates frontend and backend deployment images.
4. Waits for Kubernetes rollouts to complete.

Conceptually:

```text
Azure DevOps
      │
      ▼
az aks get-credentials
      │
      ▼
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/prod
      │
      ▼
kubectl set image
      │
      ▼
kubectl rollout status
      │
      ▼
AKS Workloads Updated
```

This is the actual deployment mechanism currently implemented in the project.

---

# 🐳 Docker Containerization Strategy

Docker provides a consistent packaging mechanism for the frontend and backend.

The project uses Docker to provide:

* Reproducible environments
* Portable application artifacts
* Consistent runtime behavior
* Simplified deployment
* Kubernetes compatibility
* Independent frontend/backend scaling

The implementation uses multi-stage builds where applicable to reduce unnecessary build-time components in runtime images.

### Container Architecture

# 📦 Azure Container Registry Integration

The project uses Azure Container Registry as the private repository for application images.

| Property     | Value                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Registry     | `flavorforgeacr2026ms`            |
| Login Server | `flavorforgeacr2026ms.azurecr.io` |
| Region       | East US                           |
| SKU          | Basic                             |

### Image Publishing Workflow

<img width="467" height="676" alt="ACR image publishing workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/144f9e74-a0e8-4bc2-b419-b364f10493f7" />

*Figure 10.2 – Container images successfully stored in Azure Container Registry.*

---

# 🔀 CI/CD and GitOps Responsibility Separation

FlavorForge demonstrates both **Azure DevOps CI/CD automation** and **Argo CD GitOps**.

These technologies have complementary responsibilities in the current implementation.

## Azure DevOps — CI and Current AKS Deployment

Azure DevOps is responsible for:

* Building the application
* Running validation
* SonarCloud analysis
* Building Docker images
* Trivy vulnerability scanning
* Publishing images to ACR
* Performing the current AKS deployment

The actual deployment stage uses Kubernetes tooling to apply the production configuration and update application images.

<img width="432" height="755" alt="Azure DevOps CI workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/205bb4eb-8f3a-4854-9445-74f974151fd5" />

---

## Argo CD — GitOps Synchronization

Argo CD is configured to monitor the Kubernetes configuration stored in Git and synchronize the cluster with the declared desired state.

<img width="397" height="352" alt="Argo CD synchronization" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c9e69b6-ff0e-477c-9d82-89c9e497b627" />

### Important Implementation Distinction

> **Azure DevOps performs the current real deployment to AKS. Argo CD demonstrates GitOps-based continuous delivery, desired-state synchronization, and drift visibility.**

This distinction accurately represents the current project implementation.

#### Evidence

![ArgoCD Application](screenshots/argo-cd/4-flavorforge-application-details-tree-argo-cd.png)

*Figure 10.3 – Argo CD managing and synchronizing the FlavorForge Kubernetes application.*

# 🌱 GitOps Deployment Model

GitOps treats Git as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configuration.

FlavorForge uses Argo CD to demonstrate this model.

## Traditional Deployment

<img width="345" height="372" alt="Traditional deployment" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71fb101f-dc79-457c-bf19-0f0d456068af" />

---

## GitOps Deployment

<img width="393" height="487" alt="GitOps deployment" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb610d1-0982-4b2e-ad2c-142a58a954c3" />

The GitOps model provides:

* Declarative configuration
* Version-controlled deployment configuration
* Synchronization
* Drift visibility
* Deployment traceability
* Simplified rollback and recovery

> In this project, GitOps is demonstrated alongside the current Azure DevOps AKS deployment rather than being represented as the only deployment mechanism.

# 🎬 Demo Walkthrough

A recommended demonstration sequence is:

1. Introduce the FlavorForge application.
2. Explain the overall architecture.
3. Show the GitHub repository structure.
4. Show the Azure infrastructure.
5. Explain the Azure DevOps pipeline.
6. Demonstrate code-quality validation with SonarCloud.
7. Demonstrate container vulnerability scanning with Trivy.
8. Show Docker images stored in Azure Container Registry.
9. Show the AKS workloads.
10. Show Kubernetes Services and Ingress.
11. Show the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
12. Show Argo CD synchronization and GitOps state.
13. Access the running FlavorForge application.
14. Verify the backend health endpoint.
15. Review the final verification evidence.

The demonstration should tell **one continuous story**:
